# Gameplay:

1. Starting the Game: The game starts by lighting up one of the buttons and playing its associated tone.
2. Repeating the Sequence: The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.
3. Increasing Complexity: After the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game adds one more button to the sequence. The player must then repeat the longer sequence.
4. Continued Play: This pattern continues, with the sequence growing longer each round.
5. Mistakes: If the player presses the wrong button or fails to reproduce the sequence, the game ends, and the playerâ€™s score is displayed.
   

# Objective:

The primary objective of Simon is to remember and repeat increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds. The game tests and improves memory and concentration skills, providing entertainment and cognitive exercise.
